# Ortho-Notes-Open-Source (ONOS)

An open-source, local-hosted ambient scribe for clinical documentation in orthopaedic trauma care.

**Author:** Nicholas J. Yee, MD

## Overview

This project provides an ambient scribe designed to improve orthopedic trauma clinical documentation workflows. The toolkit includes:

- **Medical Scribe**: Audio transcription and automated clinical note generation
- **Chatbot Arena**: LLM comparison platform for evaluating medical AI responses
- **Standardized Patients**: AI-generated patient profiles for mock interviews
- **Evaluation Framework**: Comprehensive metrics for assessing clinical note quality

## Components

### ðŸ©º Medical Scribe
A Flask-based web application that converts audio recordings into structured clinical notes.

**Features:**
- Audio file upload and transcription
- Automated SOAP note generation
- Web-based interface for easy access
- Support for multiple audio formats

**Location:** `medical_scribe/`

**Usage:**
